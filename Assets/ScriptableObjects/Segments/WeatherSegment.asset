  text: "And the weather for tomorrow, looks like there will be sun. Lot\u2019s of
    it, all around the place. \r\nSo if we take a look at the south of the country,
    we can expect temperatures up to  70 degrees fahrenheit.\r\nWhen we look at the
    North of the country, we can expect a nice cloudless sky with temperatures up
    to 69 degrees fahrenheit. \r\nFurthermore we will suggest people that are on
    holiday to the beaches to pack some sunscreen with them. And for those who aren't
    on holiday: you poor, poor basterds\r."
