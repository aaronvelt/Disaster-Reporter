  text: "Yesterday\u2019s citizens of Swinford were terrorized by a wild gooze that
    according to several locals acted like \u201Ca complete ass\u201D or \u201Cvery
    not cool\u201D. The swan was seen stealing small shiny objects like keys and
    cans. This type of behavior is more often associated with Magpie\u2019s and members
    of the crow and raven family.\r\nThe locals called an animal sanctuary to take
    care of their goose problem; this sadly backfired when the goose bullied the
    volunteers and chased them off. Aggressively honking about while doing so.\r"
