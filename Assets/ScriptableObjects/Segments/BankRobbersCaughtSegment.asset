  text: "But now our main story for tonight, \r\n\r\nThe bank robbers who attempted
    an armed robbery at South Holdings Inc. have been caught.\r\nIt was yesterday
    at 11 PM that these three men wearing ski masks and sunglasses, came into the
    building heavily armed. The robbers were out of the bank 64 seconds after the
    silent alarm went off, and 26 seconds before police arrived. \r\n\r\nOfficer
    Harrison Ryan claimed that the criminals were well prepared but made a flaw that
    eventually led to their demise, they used the same getaway vehicle to scout the
    environment two days prior. Using several images of surveillance cameras from
    the same street, police managed to get clear shots of the perpetrators' faces.\r"
