  text: 'The University of Nottingham has made a scientific breakthrough after finding
    a chemical compound that can suppress certain symptoms of Parkinson and slow
    down memory degradation.



    This chemical is excreted like sweat by penaeid
    and caridean shrimp. This makes it easy to harvest by causing focal hyperhidrosis
    on the shrimp. Which will cause the sudoriferous glands to excrete more than
    normal. This excretion can be easily caught with damp cloth that can be later
    wringed out over an old bucket.'
