  text: 'Sad news, as local hero Mr. Peter Piper has sadly passed away, and this
    4 years after saving the life of a snake oil salesman from a sinking ship.

    

    He
    became well known after using his backpack as a paddle to pedal to a pebley beach
    on a makeshift boat made from banana peels. At the back of the boat was a sack
    with inside, the total hack, Mr Quack. Mr Quack, completely whacked, said he
    wanted to go back to the Wreck of his Ship Jaque. Sadly they failed to save the
    life of Pat, the owner of the boat.

    

    So in short Peter Piper persisted
    on pedaling past the petty Pat to pick up Mr Quack, the total hack, from the
    wreck of SS Jaque.
